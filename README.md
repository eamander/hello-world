# hello-world
GitHub tutorial module -- how embarrassing!!

I'm a recent nuclear physics PhD trying to get into the manyvaried field called "data science!" 
I'm confident I'll find a place here eventually. I like fiddling with various data,
predictive analytics, and I am getting into deep learning with a little 'pet' project.
